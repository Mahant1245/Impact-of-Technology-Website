	<h1><i><u>Automated Decision Making</u></i></h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>With varied levels of human oversight or intervention, automated decision-making (ADM) refers to the use of data, machines, and algorithms
	to make decisions in a variety of contexts, including public administration, commerce, health, education, law, employment, transit, media,and entertainment.<br>
	ADM uses a variety of technologies, including computer software, algorithms, machine learning, natural language processing,
	artificial intelligence, augmented intelligence, and robotics, to process large amounts of data from a variety of sources, 
	including databases, text, social media, sensors, images, or speech.
	It is important to take into account the technological, legal, ethical, sociological, educational, economic, 
	and health ramifications of the growing usage of automated decision-making systems (ADMS) in a variety of scenarios.</p>

	<h3>Advantages and disadvantages of Automated Decision Making Teachnology</h3>
	<p><ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>There are benefits and drawbacks to automated decision-making technology. One of the primary benefits is that it may 
	assist organisations in making faster and more informed decisions by automating specific tasks and giving real-time insights. 
	This is especially useful in high-stakes situations where judgements must be made fast and properly to avoid costly blunders or save lives. </li>
	<li>Another advantage of automated decision-making technologyÂ is that it can help boost productivity, production rates, service quality, and material efficiency. 
	It can also assist you in performing jobs more precisely while saving time and money.</li>
	<li>However, there are several drawbacks to using automated decision-making technologies. The expense of substituting human labour with automated technology is one of the drawbacks of automation. 
	Other drawbacks include the high capital investment required to invest in automation (an automated system can cost millions of dollars to design, fabricate, and install), 
	a higher level of maintenance required than with a manually operated machine, and a generally lower degree of flexibility in terms of possible products 
	when compared to a manual system (even flexible automation is less flexible than humans, the most versatile machines of all).</li>
	<li>For <b>example</b>, automated decision-making technology in the medical field can assist physicians in developing more precise diagnoses and treatment regimens. 
	However, if the algorithms are poorly developed or are based on biassed data, it can also result in inaccuracies.</li>
