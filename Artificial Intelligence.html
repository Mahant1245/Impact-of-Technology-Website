	<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that enables computers to carry out operations like speech recognition, visual perception, 
	decision-making, and language translation that otherwise need human intelligence.<br>
	Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are made to learn from data and get better over time without having to be explicitly programmed.</p>
	<p>AI is applied in a variety of industries, including entertainment, banking, healthcare, and transportation. By analysing medical photos, for instance, 
	AI can assist clinicians in making faster and more accurate diagnoses of diseases. 
	AI can be used in finance to identify fraud and forecast market trends.AI in transportation can assist self-driving automobiles in effectively and safely navigating routes. 
	AI can be utilised in the entertainment industry to develop realism in video game characters and special effects.</p>

	<p>In just 5 minutes, this "What is Artificial Intelligence" video will provide you a quick overview of the field of technology.
	<br>The video begin with a brief overview of artificial intelligence, explaining what it is with the use of concrete examples.
	Moving on, it also examine the applications of AI as well as the differences between strong and weak AI.</p>

	<h2>Benefits of AI</h2>
	<p><ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>Smart Decision Making<br>
	Businesses are utilising AI technology to automate routine tasks, analyse impending trends, project future growth, and foresee consequences.
	On the websites of several large retailers, for instance, if a consumer adds an item to their shopping basket, they are immediately presented with a second item that is advised for purchase based on a sophisticated algorithm.
	This algorithm was designed to compare thousands of other consumers who had purchased comparable goods and provide a thoughtful recommendation.</li>
	<li>Research and Data Analysis<br>
	Research and data scientists may more accurately analyse trends, forecast results, and make modifications in half the time with the help of AI.
	Information that once took months to gather can now be gathered in a matter of minutes or even seconds.
	For instance, a language-learning programme like Duolingo or Babbel might find that after three months of study, half of its users reach a fluency plateau and add more encouraging courses to close the gap.
	Or a meal delivery service might utilise an algorithm to discover that stay-at-home mothers check their emails and make meal plans more frequently in the mornings, and then adjust their email marketing strategy to achieve the greatest results.
	Research on artificial intelligence and data analysis have yielded a lot of knowledge that is invaluable.</li>
	<li>Can perform 24/7<br>
	Businesses are increasingly seeking for ways to boost productivity, and AI aids in the elimination of boring, 
	repetitive jobs that frequently consume time from a productive workday. According to estimates, employees read and respond to emails for about <u>two and a half hours each day</u>, 
	making "inbox zero" (the email management approach that tries to keep one's inbox empty) a fantasy. To save time on proofreading, 
	browser extensions like Grammarly or Hemingway or email plug-ins like Boomerang employ AI to automatically correct spelling and grammar mistakes. </li>
	<li>AI in Medical Firm<br>
	 In the area of healthcare, artificial intelligence has also been used by doctors and nurses to diagnose and treat patients in a manner which does not require costly or burdensome hospital visits. 
	 The physician can monitor the glucose level in patients with diabetes using an app that tracks their glucose, 
	 and realtime information about their health from comfort at home is available to a patient who also has diabetes.</li>
	
	</ol></p>
	
	<h2>Risk of AI</h2>
	<p><ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>AI Bias<br>
	AI is only as objective as the information and people used to create the programs. Therefore, the resulting AI will be biased if the data is flawed, impartial, or biased in any other way.
	"Data bias" and "societal bias" are the two main categories of bias in AI.
	When the data used to create and train an AI is inaccurate, incomplete, or skewed, it is said to have data bias. This might be the case if the data is inaccurate, excludes certain groups, or was improperly gathered.
	On the other hand, societal bias occurs when the assumptions and biases present in modern society find their way into AI through programmers' assumptions and blind spots.</li>
	<li>Legal Responsibility<br>
	Who is to blame when something goes wrong? the actual AI? the software engineer who created it? The business that executed it? Or, if a person was present, was the person operating the device at fault?<br>
	Say for a self-driving car accident in which a pedestrian died, and the backup driver was found to be at fault.
	But does that establish a standard for all AI cases? Most likely not, as the issue is complicated and constantly changing. If something goes wrong, different applications of AI will have different legal repercussions.</li>
	<li>AI developed as Harm<br>
	Another risk that experts cite when talking about the risks of AI is the possibility that something that uses AI will be programmed to do something devastating. 
	The best example of this is the idea of “autonomous weapons” which can be programmed to kill humans in war.</li>
