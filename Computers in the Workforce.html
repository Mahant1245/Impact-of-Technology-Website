	<h1>Computers in the Workforce</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>There are several things that computers are utilised for in the workplace. The following are some of the most typical workplace uses for computers: <br>
	<ol>
	<li><b><u>Information storage and Computation:</b></u><br>
	Computers are used to store information, including databases, spreadsheets, and papers.Also complicated arithmetic algorithms work together to power computers. Complex calculations and data processing that would be hard for people to complete manually can be carried out by computers
	</li>
	<li><b><u>Communication</b></u><br>
	Keeping employees in touch both within and across businesses has been made possible by the use of email, the Internet, message boards, and social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn.
	</li>
	<li><b><u>Research</b></u><br>
	 A range of topics are researched using computers. They can be used to get information from internet databases, search engines, and other sources.
	</li>

	<h3>Benefits Associated With Using Computers in the Workspace</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li><b><u>Makes processes more efficient</b></u><br>
	Automation of operations has increased significantly as a result of computer technology, enabling organisations to create more in less time. The variety of automated processes is enormous, and it includes manufacturing operations like product design and processing.
	In both goods and services businesses, shipping, bookkeeping, and customer service management have all been streamlined.
	As opposed to just 30 years ago, when whiteout and carbon copies were frequently utilised, document drafting and editing are now done on computers, making it easier to manage the quantity of paperwork in a corporation.
	</li>
	<li><b><u>Changes employee roles</b></u><br>
	Prior to the widespread use of computers, the majority of businesses needed a warm body to handle each step of the process. Since the invention of computers, fewer humans are required to manage routine business operations, marketing, or manufacturing duties.
	This may increase a business's profits, but it doesn't do much to help the workers who lose their jobs to automation. On the other hand, mastering computer technology calls for a fresh set of abilities. People who are eager to acquire new skill sets have an opportunity to discover new forms of employment thanks to modern technology.
	</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<h3>Risk Associated With Using Computers in the Workspace<h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
	<li><b><u>Security issues</b></u><br>
	As businesses use computers more and more, the risk of security breaches increases.
	Incidents like this are rare, but there are many reports of hackers stealing sensitive customer information from businesses.
	</li>
	<li><b><u>Job losses</b></u><br>
	While many employers only care about their own interests, others care about their employees. The efficiencies created by computers can lead employers to make difficult decisions about whether to fire loyal, long-serving employees.
	Staffing reductions due to the obsolescence of computer use can also lead to conflicts with customers, especially those who have worked with them or know them well. 
	</li>
	<li><b><u>Startup expenses</b></u><br>
	Computer use can be prohibitively expensive for businesses, especially small businesses. Computers, printers, scanners and software are only part of the cost. Some software vendors may also charge an additional fee for each user that uses their software in your enterprise.
	<br>Additionally, many businesses require IT support in the event of a computer failure, and this support can be expensive depending on the severity of the problem.
